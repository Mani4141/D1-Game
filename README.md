UI Credits and Inspirations (D1.d)

For the D1.d: Interface Refinement update, I improved my game’s user interface by drawing inspiration from other student projects in the CMPM 121 D1 Gallery:
[KupoDupo’s D1 Project](https://github.com/KupoDupo/CMPM-121-D1-Incremental-Game)

Primary Button Emphasis:
The glowing ring and subtle pulse animation around the main “Mine Crystal” button were inspired by KupoDupo’s D1 project
, which used a circular backdrop to make the primary action visually dominant.

Upgrade Card Styling:
The framed, gradient “card” design for each upgrade button was inspired by Riya Iyer’s D1 project
, which featured boxed upgrades for better readability.

Hover Interaction Effect:
The raised hover motion that makes upgrades feel tactile was inspired by ThatGuyIain’s D1 project,
which improved button feedback through smooth elevation transitions.
